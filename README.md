# Analyzing the Effect of COVID19 on South Korean Tourism by using Data Mining

This is a project on Analysing the Effect of COVID19 on South Korean Tourism Industry. 

The dataset used for this project is some recent tourist data from Kaggle based on the South Korean tourism records from January 2019 to April 2019.

The major goal of this course project is to do an exploratory data analysis on the entire dataset and use time series forecasting methods to estimate how the Covid-19 pandemic might have affected the South Korean tourism industry.

The time series tourism data from January 2019 to April 2019 is analysed using ARIMA and PROPHET models to forecast visitor count from China in the months of January 2020 – April 2020

The forecasted visitor count from January 2020 – April 2020 is compared with the actual visitor count in this time period to identify and analyse the effect of Covid19 on South Korean tourism for Chinese visitors.
